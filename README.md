## **Movie Genre Classification â€“ CodSoft Internship Task 1**

### **ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**

This project is part of my **Machine Learning Internship at CodSoft**.
The goal is to build a **Movie Genre Classification model** that predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary.

The project uses **TF-IDF (Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency)** for feature extraction and experiments with **three machine learning classifiers**:

* **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
* **Logistic Regression**
* **Linear SVM (LinearSVC)**


### **ðŸ›  Tech Stack & Libraries**

* **Anaconda Navigator**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Pandas, NumPy**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn**


### **ðŸš€ Steps Performed**

1. **Data Loading** â€“ Read and clean the dataset (`train_data.txt`).
2. **Text Preprocessing** â€“ Removed null values, extra spaces, and tokenized text.
3. **Feature Extraction** â€“ Used TF-IDF vectorization on the movie plots.
4. **Model Building** â€“ Trained and compared three classifiers:

   * Naive Bayes
   * Logistic Regression
   * Linear SVM (fast and accurate for text classification)
5. **Evaluation** â€“ Calculated accuracy, generated classification reports, and plotted a confusion matrix.
